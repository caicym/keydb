What is Keydb?
--------------

I want to use a key-value database like redis,use easly and run fast,but capacity limited by memory.

I want to use a big capacity databse like mysql,but it not designed to key-value storage.

Keydb is a fast key-value-store disk based storage service.


Keydb core performance?
